# HomeScope: Predictive Real Estate Analytics

### Project Overview
HomeScope is a comprehensive data science project designed to estimate real estate prices using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing key housing features, this project aims to build a reliable predictive model that assists in accurately determining house prices.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithms**: Various regression models

### Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**: Performed extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and data transformations, ensuring high-quality input for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to uncover trends and relationships among housing features, enhancing the interpretability and reliability of model outputs.
- **Model Implementation & Evaluation**: Trained and tested multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods. Compared performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning & K-Fold Validation**: Applied hyperparameter tuning and K-fold cross-validation to optimize model performance and ensure robust evaluation.
- **Insights & Comparative Analysis**: Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm to select the best-fit model for accurate price predictions.
